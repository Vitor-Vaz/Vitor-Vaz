<h2> 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐥𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞,<𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎𝚛𝚜/>!</h2>

Hi, I'm Vitor Vaz! I'm from Paraná, Brazil, and currently based in Rio de Janeiro. I graduated in System Analysis and Development from Unicarioca in 2020, and since 2021, I've been working as a Back End Developer at Stone Co, where I've been building and maintaining high-scale distributed systems.

My main focus has been on Go (Golang) and Elixir, working on everything from developing new features and fixing bugs to doing code reviews and deploying to production. I've had the chance to work on some really cool projects, including helping to build a new authentication and authorization system from the ground up and creating internal tools and libraries used by multiple engineering teams.

I'm also experienced with event-driven architecture using Apache Kafka, background job processing with Oban (Elixir) and River (Go), and building observability with custom metrics and Grafana dashboards.

Most of my repositories here are a mix of personal projects and contributions from my professional work. I'm always learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques—feel free to explore my code and reach out if you'd like to connect!

What I'm up to:

🚀 Working with: Go, Elixir, Kafka, PostgreSQL

📚 Exploring: System Design and Software Architecture
