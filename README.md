Hi, I'm Vitor Vaz, a Back End Developer passionate about building the systems that power great products. With 4 years at Stone Co, I've worked hands-on with Go (Golang) and Elixir, tackling challenges like creating a new auth system from the ground up, developing internal tools used across multiple teams, and ensuring system reliability through observability. This is where I share my code and personal projects.

What I'm up to:

💼 Back End Developer at Stone Co

🚀 Working with: Go, Elixir, Kafka, PostgreSQL

📚 Exploring: System Design and Software Architecture
